Basic information
  General information:
    Course project, operating systems.
    
    This program is designed to track the parameters of the technological process and build a graph of these parameters.
    The program provides the ability to connect data export libraries and libraries of mathematical data processing.
    The program also allows you to save a table of values ​​of technological process parameters and an image of the resulting graph.

  Customization options:
    - Enable / Disable display of video of the technological process.
    - Enable / Disable the loading screen display when the program starts.
    - Enable / Disable export libraries.
    -Turn on / off libraries of mathematical data processing.

    Libraries are connected to the project dynamically.
    Application settings are saved in the registry.

  <LoadingData>
Loading data
  Loading data for the program is possible from *.txt files.
  
  The data in the file must be in the following format:
      value value value
      value value value
      .....
      value value value

  Limitations of the data presentation format:
    - There must be ONE space between the values ​​in the file.
    - After the last value in the line, a space is NOT put.
    - All lines, EXCEPT THE LAST, end with a line break.
    - The fractional part of value must be separated by a COMMA.
    - If a number is represented in an exponential notation, the exponent can be written in both lowercase and uppercase LATIN letters.
  </LoadingData>
  <SavingData>
Saving data
  Saving data from the program is possible in two formats:
    - *.txt to save the table of values
    - *.jpg to save the chart image

  The option to save the chart image is available only if it was built in the program.
  </SavingData>
  <Export>
Export
  The program's data export capabilities depend on the library you are using.
  
  The default installation contains two libraries:
    - MSExcelExport.dll, which supports export of table of values as well as graphics to Microsoft Excel.
    - MSWordExport.dll, which only supports export of table of values.
  
  You can specify the path to one of these or third-party libraries in the "Settings" window in the "Export type DLL" item.
  </Export>
  <Math>
Math
  The capabilities of the program for mathematical data processing depend on the library used.
   
  The default installation contains one library:
    - Interpolation.dll, which implements data interpolation.
    
  You can specify the path to this or third-party libraries in the Preferences window in the Math type DLL program.

  IMPORTANT: When using libraries of mathematical data processing, the program will display already processed data.
    Also, when saving or exporting data, the processed data will be used.

  EXPORT DLL API

        For correct collaboration of the application and dll in the library project, you must use the following function formats:
          - public string Name => "" - returns the name of the program to export to.
          - public void Export(double[][] table) - generates and saves a file.

        Also, the library file name must match the namespace, and the class must be named "EXPORT".


  MATH DLL API

        For correct collaboration of the application and dll in the library project, you must use the following function formats:
          - public string Name => "" - returns the name of the mathematical data processing method.
          - public double[][] Process(double[][] table) - returns the processed value table.
        
          Also, the library file name must match the namespace, and the class must be named "MATH".
